The Mahamudra Upadesha
======================

I've wanted to write down some advice on meditation practice for some
years, but couldn't decide the  correct format for doing it. I read
that Garchen Rinpoche recommended that all his students study the
Mahamudra Upadesha. So I decided to write a commentary on it a weave
my own advice on meditation into it. Although the Mahmudra Upadesha is
a Tantric Buddhist text, I believe it holds value for all meditators,
whatever their spiritual tradition.  And so I have tried to explain
the text in a way that will not limit its appeal to BUddhists. May we
all be able to help each other, learn from each other, and support
each other in the practice of meditation.

It's traditional to begin a Tibetan text the was originally from India
with its title both in Tibetan and Sanskrit:

> rgya gar skad du/ mahAmudra-upadesha/  
> bod skad du / phyag rgya chen po’i man ngag/   

> In Sanskrit: Mahamudra Upadesha   
> In Tibetan: Chagya Chenpo Men Ngag   
> In English: Oral Instructions on Mahamudra   

This is done for two reasons: first, to show the authenticity of the
text and, second, to express appreciation for the translator who
translated it into Tibetan.

I translated the second word in the Sanskrit title, *upadesha*, as
oral instructions. *Upadesha* means personal advice. As, such, it is
tailored to the person it is offered to. It is short and to the point
and does not include lengthy quotations from scriptures to establish
the author's point. Because Naropa was a long time student of Tilopa
at the time Tilopa gave his instruction, he did not need a lengthy or
detailed explanation. Thet instruction just covers the main
points. For that reason it is useful to learn, study, and memorize.

The first word in the Sanskrit title, *Mahamudra*, is the proper name
of a specific kind of meditation. It is usually translated as "Great
Seal."  And the name is explained by saying that there is a nature
that all things have that is like a seal upon them. That nature is
disclosed by the practice of meditation. Because that seal is on
everything, including the mind of the meditator, it is called the
"Great Seal," or *Mahamudra*.

> Homage to Vajradakini

It is also traditional to begin a commentary with an homage to an
enlightened being. Here the homage is to Vajradakini, also known as
Vajrayogini, who is the center of many Tantric practices. Dakinis are
wise women who are guardians of Tantra. At several points in Tilopa's
life he received and followed the advice of dakinis. Naropa also
followed the advice of a dakini, who told him to seek out Tilopa as a
teacher.
