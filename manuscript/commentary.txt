Advice on Mahamudra
===================

I've wanted to write down some advice on meditation practice for some
years, but couldn't decide the  correct format for doing it. I read
that Garchen Rinpoche recommended that all his students study the
Mahamudra Upadesha. So I decided to write a commentary on it a weave
my own advice on meditation into it. Although the Mahmudra Upadesha is
a Tantric Buddhist text, I believe it holds value for all meditators,
whatever their spiritual tradition.  And so I have tried to explain
the text in a way that will not limit its appeal to BUddhists. May we
all be able to help each other, learn from each other, and support
each other in the practice of meditation.

It's traditional to begin a Tibetan text the was originally from India
with its title both in Tibetan and Sanskrit:

> rgya gar skad du/ mahAmudra-upadesha/  
> bod skad du / phyag rgya chen po’i man ngag/   

> In Sanskrit: Mahamudra Upadesha   
> In Tibetan: Chagya Chenpo Men Ngag   
> In English: Advice on Mahamudra   

This is done for two reasons: first, to show the authenticity of the
text and, second, to express appreciation for the translator who
translated it into Tibetan.

I translated the second word in the Sanskrit title, *upadesha*, as
oral instructions. *Upadesha* means personal advice. As, such, it is
tailored to the person it is offered to. It is short and to the point
and does not include lengthy quotations from scriptures to establish
the author's point. Because Naropa was a long time student of Tilopa
at the time Tilopa gave his instruction, he did not need a lengthy or
detailed explanation. Thet instruction just covers the main
points. For that reason it is useful to learn, study, and memorize.

The first word in the Sanskrit title, *Mahamudra*, is the proper name
of a specific kind of meditation. It is usually translated as "Great
Seal."  And the name is explained by saying that there is a nature
that all things have that is like a seal upon them. That nature is
disclosed by the practice of meditation. Because that seal is on
everything, including the mind of the meditator, it is called the
"Great Seal," or *Mahamudra*.

> rdo rje mkha’ ’gro la phyag ’tshal lo/

> Homage to Vajradakini

It is also traditional to begin a commentary with an homage to an
enlightened being. Here the homage is to Vajradakini, also known as
Vajrayogini, who is the focus of many Tantric practices. Dakinis are
wise women who are guardians of Tantra. At several points in Tilopa's
life he received and followed the advice of dakinis. Naropa also
followed the advice of a dakini, who told him to seek out Tilopa as a
teacher. 

> phya rgya chen po bstan du med kyis kyang/ 
> dka’ ba spyod cing bla ma la gus pas/
> sdug bsngal bzod ldan blo ldan nA ro pa/
> skal ldan khyod kyi snying la ’di ltar byos/

> Mahamudra cannot be taught, but
> You, who practiced austerities for the teacher from devotion
> And patiently bore sufferings, intelligent Naropa
> Fortunate one, listen to this and take it to your heart

Tilopa was a yogi who gathered together the tantric teachings as well
as teachings on mahmudra and passed them onto Naropa. Naropa was
originally a monk and a scholar, one of the four principal teachers at
the Buddhist monastic school, Nalanda. At that time it was not
possible to be a monk and a tantric practitioner. But Naropa's zeal
for finding the truth was so great that he left the monastery, went
searching for Tilopa as a teacher, and underwent hardship as his
student.

Finding the truth is not hard, but it does require one hundred percent
of your effort. The German theosophist Rudolf Steiner once explained
the difference between chemistry and alchemy, saying that in chemistry
you are holding a test tube over a flame, but in alchemy you are in the
test tube getting cooked. Meditation is exactly like that. You cannit
do it casually or at arm's length of you want to see the truth. It has
to be a complete commitment. And that is how Naropa practiced.

The first line says that mahamudra cannot be taught. This is for two
reasons. First, mahamudra is something that needs to pacticed and not
learned. You cannot learn to meditate from someone else, you need to
practice it yourself and learn from that.

The second reason mahamudra cannot be taught requires explaining some
Buddhist philosophy. According to this philosophy, the first moment of
perception is free of thoughts. In subsequent moments, the perception
of the object is replaced with a generalized concept about the
object. For example, in the first moment you see the car as it
actually is, but after that the perception becomes one instance of the
more generalized idea of a car. You classify it, categorize it, and
judge it. The practice of mahamudra is to remain in that original
moment of thought as much as possible. Because this moment precedes
thoughts and concepts, it cannot be taught.
