rgya gar skad du/ mahAmudra-upadesha/ 
bod skad du / phyag rgya chen po’i man ngag/

In Sanskrit: Mahamudra Upadesha
In Tibetan: Chagya Chenpo Men Ngag
In English: Oral Instructions on Mahamudra

rdo rje mkha’ ’gro la phyag ’tshal lo/

Homage to Vajrayogini

phya rgya chen po bstan du med kyis kyang/ 
dka’ ba spyod cing bla ma la gus pas/
sdug bsngal bzod ldan blo ldan nA ro pa/
skal ldan khyod kyi snying la ’di ltar byos/

Mahamudra cannot be taught, but
You, who practiced austerities for the teacher from devotion
And patiently bore sufferings, intelligent Naropa
Fortunate one, listen to this and take it to heart

dper na nam mkha’ gang gis gang la brten/ 
de bzhin phyag rgya che la brten yul med/
ma bcos gnyug ma’i ngang du klong la zhog/
bcings pa klod na grol bar the tshom med/

For example, what is the support of space?
Similarly, mahamudra is not dependent on any object
Rest in midst of uncontrived naturalness
And by letting it be no doubt what is bound will be released

dper na nam mkha’i dkyil bltas mthong bar ’gag par ’gyur/
de bzhin sems kyis sems la bltas byas na/
rnam rtog tshogs ’gag bla med byang chub thob/

For example, looking at the center of the sky, sights will cease
Similarly, it is taught that when the mind looks at the mind
The collection of thoughts cease 
and perfect unsurpassed enlightenment is attained

dper na khug rna sprin rnams nam mkha’i khams su dengs/ 
gar yang song ba med cing gang du’ang gnas pa med/ 
de bzhin sems las byung ba’i rtog tshogs kyang/ 
rang sems mthong bas rtog pa’i rba rlabs dengs/ 

For example, clouds and mist dissolve into the sky
Without staying or going anywhere
Thoughts which arise in the mind are like that
When your mind is looked at the waves of thought dissolve

dper na nam mkha’i rang bzhin kha dog dbyibs las ’das/ 
dkar nag dag gis gos shing ’gyur ba med/ 
de bzhin rang sems snying po kha dog dbyibs las ’das/ 
dge sdig dkar nag chos kyis gos mi ’gyur/ 

For example, by nature space is beyond color or shape
Its purity cannot become colored by black and white
Similarly, the essence of your mind is beyond color or shape
And cannot be changed by black or white deeds

dper na gsal dwangs nyi ma’i snying po de/ 
bskal pa stong gi mun pas bsgrib mi nus/ 
de bzhin rang sems snying po’i ’od gsal de/ 
bskal pa’i ’khor bas bsgrib par mi nus so/ 

For example, the disk of the sun is radiant
And cannot be obscured by the darkness of a thousand eons
Similarly the essence of your mind is clear light
And cannot be obscured by eons in cyclic existence

dper na nam mkha’ stong par tha snyad rab btags kyang/ 
nam mkha’ la ni ’di ’dra brjod du med/ 
de bzhin rang sems ’od gsal brjod gyur kyang/ 
’di ’drar grub ces tha snyad gdags gzhi med/ 

For example, space is designated by the term empty
But space cannot be described by words like that
Similarly your mind is declared to be clear light
But it cannot be grasped through any verbal designation

de ltar sems kyi rang bzhin gdod nas nam mkha’ ’dra/ 
chos rnams ma lus de ru ma ’dus med/ 
lus kyi bya ba yongs thong rnal ma dal bar sdod/ 
ngag gi smra brjod med de grag stong brag cha ’dra/ 

In this way the nature of mind has always been like space
All phenomena without exception are also non-existent 
Abandon physical activities and remain natural
See your ordinary speech as unreal, like an echo

yid la ci yang mi bsam la bzla’i chos la ltos/ 
lus la snying po med de smyug ma’i sdong po ’dra/ 
sems ni nam mkha’i dkyil ltar bsam pa’i yul las ’das/ 
de yi ngang la btang bzhag med par klod la zhog 

View whatever arises in the mind without deliberation
Your body has no essence, it is like a bamboo stalk
Let your mind go beyond concepts, like the clear sky
Free the mind and let it be, without holding or letting go

sems la gtad so med na phyag rgya chen po yin/ 
de la sgom shing ’dris na bla med byang chub thob/ 

Mahamudra is practice is without goal
Well acquainted with this single meditation, 
You will attain unsurpassed enlightenment

sngags su smra dang pha rol phyin pa dang/ 
’dul ba mdo sde sde snod sna tshogs kyi/ 
rang rang gzhung dang grub pa’i mtha’ yis ni/ 
’od gsal phyag rgya chen po mthong mi ’gyur/ 
zhe ’dod byung bas ’od gsal ma thong bsgribs/ 
rtog pa’i bsrung sdom dam tshig don las nyams/

Those who practice tantra and the perfections,
The vinaya, the sutras, and the collections
Their own philosphies and commentaries
Will not see the clear light of mahamudra
The clear light is obscured by their aspirations
Conceptual thought blocks the true meaning of the commitments 

yid la mi byed zhe ’dod kun dang bral/ 
rang byung rang zhi chu yi rba rlabs ’dra/ 
mi gnas mi dmigs don las mi ’da’ na/ 
dam tshig mi ’da’ mun pa’i sgron me yin/ 

Beyond all desires, all mental activity
Will subside by themselves like waves in the water
Without dwelling, or observing, or transgressing the true meaning
You are a light in the darkness, not transgressing these commitments

zhe ’dod kun bral mtha’ la mi gnas na/ 
sde snod chos rnams ma lus mthong bar’gyur/ 
don ’dir gzhol na ’khor ba’i btson las thar/ 
don ’dir mnyam gzhag sdig sgrib thams cad bsreg 

Finally free of every desire, not abiding in extremes
The meaning of all the the collections of teachings is seen
If you apply yourself to the ultimate meaning
You will be freed from the prison of cyclic existence 
And meditative equipoise will consume every defilement and obscuration

bstan pa’i sgron me zhes su bshad pa yin/ 
don ’dir mi mos skye bo blun po rnams/ 
’khor ba’i chu bos rtag tu khyer bar zad/ 
sdug bsngal mi zad blun po snying re rje/ 

Then you are a spiritual guide who can explain
The meaning to foolish persons devoid of faith
Exhausted by the stream of cyclic existence carrying them along
Foolish ones worthy of compassion because of their endless suffering

sdug bsngal mi bzod thar ’dod bla ma mkhas la brten/ 
byin rlabs snying la zhugs nas rang sems grol bar ’gyur/
kye ho/ ’khor ba’i chos ’di don med sdug bsngal rgya/ 
byas ba’i chos la snying po me pas don ldan snying po ltos/ 

Overwhelmed by suffering, and wishing to be liberated by a wise teacher
Their minds will be liberated when the blessings enter their hearts
Alas, the worldly phenomena have no meaning and result in suffering
As constructed phenomena have no essence, 
See the essence in the definitive meaning

gzung ’dzin kun las ’das na lta ba’i rgyal po yin/ 
yengs pa med na sgom pa’i rgyal po yin/ 
bya rtsol med na spyod pa’i rgyal po yin/ 
re dogs med na ’bras bu mngon du gyur/ 

Transcending dualism is the king of views
Non-distraction is the king of meditations
No deliberate action is the king of behaviour
The result is realized when you are without hope or fear

dmigs pa’i yul ’das sems kyi rang bzhin gsal/ 
bgrod pa’i lam med sangs rgyas lam na zin/ 
sgom pa’i yul med bla med byang chub thob/

The nature of mind is clarity, beyond any frame of reference
By not traversing the path, you attain the path to Buddhahood
Through objectless meditation you attain unsurpassable enlightenment

kye ma ’jig rten chos la legs rtogs dang/ 
rtag mi thub ste rmi lam sgyu ma ’dra/ 
rmi lam sgyu ma don la yod ma yin/ 
des na skyo ba bskyed la ’jig rten bya ba thong/ 

Alas, know that the phenomena of this world
Are as lasting as dreams and illusions
And like dreams and illusions have no reality
Thus, disenchanted with worldly activities, abandon them

’khor yul chags sdang ’brel pa kun chod la/ 
gcig pur nags ’dab ri khrod dgon par bsgom/ 
bsgom du med pa’i ngang la gnas par kyis/ 
thob med thob na phyag rgya chen po thob/ 

Cut off all connection to the likes and dislikes of this world
And meditate alone in a forest hermitage
By remaining in the meditation which is non-meditation
You will attain the non-attainment of mahamudra

dper na ljon shing sdong po yal ga lo ’dab rgyas/ 
rtsa ba gcig bcad yal ka khri ’bum skam/ 
de bzhin sems kyi rtsa ba bcas pas ’khor ba’i lo ’dab skam/ 
 
For example, the ten thousand branches and leaves of a tree
Will wither when its single root is cut
Similarly, when the root of mind is cut, 
the leaves and branches of samsara dry up

dper na bskal pa stong du bsags pa’i mun pa yang/
sgron me gcig gis mun pa’i tshogs rnams sel/ 
de bzhin rang sems ’od gsal skad cig gis/ 
bskal par bsags pa’i ma rig sdig sgrib sel/

For example, the darkness of a thousand eons
Is banished by a single lamp
Similarly the clear light of your own mind instantly
Clears away the ignorance of a thousand eons

kye ho/ blo yi chos kyis blo ’das don mi mthong/ 
byas pa’i chos kyis byar med don mi rtogs/ 
blo ’das byar med don de thob ’dod na/ 
rang sems rtsa ba chod la rig pa gcer bu zhog/ 

Alas, the meaning of what is beyond concepts 
Cannot be understood by the intellect
The meaning of what is without effort
Cannot be understood by striving
If you wish to attain what is beyond concept and effort
Use naked awareness to cut off the root of your mind

rtog pa dri ma’i chu de dbangs su chug
snang ba dgag sgrub ma byed rang sar zhog
spang blang med pa’i snang srid phyag rgya che/ 
kun gzhi skye ba med pas bag chags sgrib g.yogs sangs/ 

Let the muddied water of conceptual thoughts clear
Rest naturally in appearances without altering them
Mahmudra does not invite or reject phenomena
Purifying latent tendencies from begingless time in the subconscious

snyem byed rtsis gdab mi bya skye med snying po zhog
snang ba rang snang blo yi chos rnams zad du chug

Put aside arrogant opinions on the unborn nature
Let the manifest appearances of phenomena exhaust themselves

mu tha’ yongs grol lta ba’i rgyal po mchog
mu med gting yangs sgom pa’i rgyal po mchog
mtha’ chod phyogs bral spyod pa’i rgyal po mchog 
re med rang gnas ’bras bu’i mchog yin no/ 

The supreme king of views is total liberation without limit
The supreme king of meditations is deep, vast and boundless
The supreme king of actions cuts the proliferations of extreme views
Making one's home in the wishless, you obtain the supreme result

las ni dang po gcong rong ’bab chu ’dra/ 
bar du chu bo gang ga dal zhing g.yo/ 
tha ma chu rnams ma bu phrad pa ’dra/ 

At first, your practice is like a moutain stream rushing through a ravine
Then it is like the Ganges river, flowing slowly through the plains
Finally, it is like the waters of the son merging into the mother

blo dman skye bo ngang la mi gnas na/ 
rlung gi gnad bzung rig pa bcud la bor/ 
lta stangs sems ’dzin yan lag du ma yis/ 
rig pa ngang la mi gnas bar du gcun/ 

Persons of less intelligence, who cannot abide in the nature
Should take up the key point of the inner winds
And the various auxilliary practices of the gazes and concentrations
Exerting themselves while they do not abide in awareness

las kyi phyag rgya bsten na bde stong ye shes ’char/ 
thabs dang shes rab byin rlabs snyoms par ’jug 
dal bar dbab cing bskyil bzlog drang pa dang/ 
gnas su bskyal la lus la khyab par dgram/ 

Rely on a consort until the union of bliss and wisdom dawns
The blessing power of the balance of skill in means and wisdom
Gradually draw it down, hold, and reverse it
Carry it to its abode and then extend it until it pervades the body


de la chags zhen med na bde stong ye shes ’char/ 
tshe ring skra dkar med cing zla ltar rgyas par ’gyur/ 
bkrag mdangs gsal la stobs kyang seng ge ’gra/ 
thun mong dngos grub myur thob mchog la gzhol bar ’gyur/

The union of bliss and emptiness will dawn if you are without clinging
You will have long life, no grey hair, and flourish like the waxing moon
Your appearance will be bright and lustrous 
and you will have the strength of a lion
You will quickly attain the common accomplishments
And endeavor to attain the supreme accomplisment

phyag rgya chen po gnad kyi man ngag ’di/ 
’gro ba skal ldan snying la gnas par shog

This is the pith instruction of mahamudra
Fortunate persons should take it to heart

phyag rgya chen po’i zhal snga nas mdzad pa/
kha che’i pandita mkhas pa grub thob pa nA ro pas
dka’ ba bcu gnyis spyad pa’i mthar chu bo gang ga’i
’gram du tee lo pas gsungs pa/ 


This mahamudra intruction was composed orally for
The Kashmira pandita the intelligent Naropa
Who underwent twelve extreme trials 
by the banks of the river Ganges,. It was spoken by Tilopa.

phyag rgya chen po rdo rje’i tshig rkang nyi shu
rtsa brgyad pa zhes bya ba na’ ro pa chen po’i zhal snga nas/

These twenty vajra verses mahamudra
And eight on tantra were given to the great Naropa

bod kyi lo tsa’ ba chen po sgra sgyur gyi rgyal po 
mar pa chos kyi blo gros kyis byang phu la ha rir bsgyur zhing zhus 
te gtan la phab pa’o// 

And was requested by the best of translators, 
Marpa Lotsawa of Tibet in the pure land of Pulahari
This concludes it
